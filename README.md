# Band website

This website is a design idea by me for a hypothetical rock/grunge/punk band. 
The idea is to create a website looking different, but still well-arranged and clear.

Created while studying JAVA development at FDM Group. 


## Visit the band

The website is available on https://callyyna.github.io/bandweb/ for you to look at. 

## Technologies

This website was created purely with HTML5 and CSS3.

## Future implementations
- Adding additional pages
- Button and links route to other pages
- Implement CSS framework
